"""
Services package.

Why use a service layer?
1. Business Logic Separation: Keep business logic out of routes
2. Reusability: Services can be called from routes, CLI, background jobs
3. Testability: Easy to unit test business logic in isolation
4. Framework Independence: Services are pure Python (enables Flask → Django migration)

Services will be created in Module 4.
