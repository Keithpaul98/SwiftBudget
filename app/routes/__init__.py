"""
Routes package.

Why use blueprints?
- Modularity: Each feature (auth, transactions, dashboard) has its own blueprint
- Organization: Routes grouped by functionality
- Scalability: Easy to add new route modules
- Reusability: Blueprints can be registered to multiple apps

Blueprints will be created in Module 3 and beyond.
