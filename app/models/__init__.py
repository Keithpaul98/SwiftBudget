"""
Models package.

Why separate models into a package?
- Organization: Each model in its own file (user.py, transaction.py, etc.)
- Scalability: Easy to add new models without cluttering a single file
- Imports: Centralized model imports for easy access

This file will be populated in Module 2.

# Models will be imported here in Module 2
# from app.models.user import User
# from app.models.category import Category
# from app.models.transaction import Transaction
